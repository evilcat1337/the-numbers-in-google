#The Numbers in Google

The idea is simple. Let’s make a Google search for every number, from 0 to The Very Large Number; save the number of results returned by Google and plot them on a graph.

For more details, [check my blog](http://conradthegray.com/projects/the-numbers-in-google/). 

##What's inside?

`numbers.json` contains the results for every number from 0 to 1000000 in JSON format, where key is the number and the value is the result.

##Todo

* Create Matlab/Octave file with results

Basically, you can do whatever you want with the results. If you find something interesting, please share your results and [let me](mailto:hello@conradthegray.com) know what did you find.
